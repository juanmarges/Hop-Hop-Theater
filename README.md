# Hop-Hop-Theater

Have a free day to watch movies and want to plan out your movie watching experience?
###### want to plan out your theater hopping experience?
Use Hop-Hop-Theater! Your One Movie Watching Scheduler!

## What is Hop-Hop-Theater?

Hop-Hop Theater as a mobile application (in-progress) built using Flutter. It allows you to:
 - Bring up a list of nearby theaters based on your location
 - Get a list of movies and their current showtimes for a selected theater
 - (TO BE CONTINUED) Queue up a schedule of movies to plan out your theater watching experience

## Getting Started

This app is a work in progress, so to run the app, you need to do following:

1. Have Flutter installed. [Flutter's installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
  - T
2. Have your editor set up.[Flutter editors](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
 - VSCode, Android Studio, or something else? Doesn't matter! So long as you have the appropriate plugins set up
 - I personally used VSCode, but still had Android Studio installed from the previous step
3. Have an environment to run the app, either an Android Emulator or USB Debugging enabled Android Device
4. Run "flutter doctor" to make sure everything is running correctly. If some sections are failing, complete the prompts to get the project running.
5. Run "flutter run". First time rendering should take a while.

## Things to Add

As anyone that even tries to run can tell, this is still a work in progress, far from even an alpha release. As such, here are a couple things to add:
[] Get the pages to connect successfully.
[] Fix the movies page to load properly.
[] Add a page to display the schedule.
